## Solution

Due to low constraints, a brute force solution is sufficient for this problem. For every possible quartet of cards, check every way of pairing them into two pairs. Then, check if the pairs are completed by the same card. Special attention should be paid to ensure that no double counting occurs. A more clever approach, however, is required for Plus Ultra Set.
