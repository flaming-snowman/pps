Only one summer contest this year. We had problems ranging from USACO wood to gold. Only 4 questions received successful solves. I have included my solutions (and some submissions in other languages) to problems that were solved. Unsolved problems may be reused in the future for a practice contest.

The contest can be found here: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/pps-summer-contest-2021. Submissions are still open and testcases are now available. However, the leaderboard has been locked.

The problem difficulty based off of solve percentages was: 1 < 2 < 3 < 4
