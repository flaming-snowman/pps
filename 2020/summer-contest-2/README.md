Our second contest of the summer! This contest saw relatively low participation but nevertheless had some interesting challenges.

The contest can be found here: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/pps-summer-contest-2. Submissions are still open and testcases are now public. However, the leaderboard has been locked.

The problem difficulty based on in-contest solve counts was: 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6. (Wow! Correct problem ordering for once).
