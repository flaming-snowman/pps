A very short contest held over spring break (only 2 problems!).

The contest can be found here: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/spring-break-contest-part-1. Submissions are still open and testcases are now public. However, the leaderboard has been locked.

The second problem is significantly harder than the first.
