## Problem

Given a positive integer N and a string of length N consisting of only A's and B's, count the number of C's in the string.

**Input Format**

Line 1 - N
Line 2 - the string of length N, consisting of only A's and B's

**Constraints**

0 <= N <= 10 ^ 69

## Solution

Reading the question carefully, we notice that it's a troll question and the answer is always 0 (there are only A's and B's, never C's). Reading the input is not even neccessary. I've included solutions in C++, Python and Bash.
