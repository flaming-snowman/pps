Our first contest of the summer! Problems ranged from USACO wood to silver difficulty, with an easy gold problem at the end. Insaner Math turned out to be too much insaner, with no solves.

The contest can be found here: https://www.hackerrank.com/pps-summer-contest-1. Submissions are still open and testcases are now available. However, the leaderboard has been locked.

Interestingly, the problem difficulty based off of solve percentages was: 1 = 2 < 3 = 4 < 7 < 9 < 5 < 6 <<< 8
