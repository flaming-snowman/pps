## Solution

Simply count the occurrences of the substring "FEE" in the total string. Looping through the entire string works (make sure not to go out of bounds). Python has a built-in count function that instantly kills the problem. Make sure to consider the special case of N=0, as there is no string to read in. This final test case caused run time errors for many Python and Java solutions.
