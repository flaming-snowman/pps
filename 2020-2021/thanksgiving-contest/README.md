Over Thanksgiving break, we held our first ever Thanksgiving contest. We had our highest participation yet, with submissions from over 20 different club members. This contest also featured the most problems we've ever had on one contest, with 13 challenges of varying difficulty to solve.

The contest problems can all be found here: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/pps-thanksgiving-contest. Submissions are still open but the leaderboard has been locked.

The problem difficulty based on in-contest solve counts was: 1 < 3 < 4 < 2 < 5 < 6 < 8 = 11 < 7 = 9 < 10 = 12 = 13
