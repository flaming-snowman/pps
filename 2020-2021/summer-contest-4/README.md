PPS Summer Contest 4! The problems this time around featured some slightly more advanced algorithms right off the bat, but the difficulty among the problems was still fairly well-balanced so coders of all levels had something to do :)

Find the contest problems here: https://www.hackerrank.com/pps-summer-contest-4. Submissions are still open but the leaderboard has been locked.

The problem difficulty based on in-contest solve counts was: 1 < 5 = 4 < 2 < 3

(Sorry for not copying over problem statements and not including submissions aside from my own this time around. Problem credits go to Shreyas Thumathy and Elden Ren)
