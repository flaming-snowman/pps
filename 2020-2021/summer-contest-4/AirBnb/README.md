A fun sorting and searching problem. The solution I used involved sorting the customers in order of arrival date. We want to process them in the order they arrive. Then, we keep a priority queue of when each customer leaves. The priority queue always has the customer who leaves first at the top. If the customer who leaves first leaves before the next customer, the new one can take their room. Otherwise, we need a new room. This is a greedy algorithm that works efficiently.
