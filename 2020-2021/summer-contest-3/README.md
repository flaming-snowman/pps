Our third contest of the summer! We had a few new participants this time around and I want to congratulate everyone who signed up and participated. There was a good mix of problems for both beginners and more experienced programmers. This time around, I did not participate in the creation of the contest and competed instead.

The contest can be found here: https://www.hackerrank.com/pps-summer-contest-3. Submissions are still open and testcases are now public. However, the leaderboard has been locked.

The problem difficulty based on in-contest solve percentanges was: 1 < 3 < 5 < 2 < 4 < 6 = 7 < 8 = 9
