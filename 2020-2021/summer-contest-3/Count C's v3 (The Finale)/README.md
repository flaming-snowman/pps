# Count C's v3 (The Finale)

* **Difficulty:** Easy
* **Points:** 10
* **Problem Creator:** Jack Chang 

## Problem

Given a non-negative integer N and a string of length N, output the number of C's within the string. The string will only consist of uppercase letters.

**Input Format**

Line 1 - N
Line 2 - The string of length N

**Constraints**

0 <= N <= 10 ^ 7

**Output Format**

Line 1 - The number of C's inside the string

## Solution

The end of a trilogy. For this final challenge, we simply loop through the characters of the string and count occurences of the letter C. Some languages may have built in count functions, which makes this even easier. The C++ solution can be easily adapted to any language.
